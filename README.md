# RipplePaperWallet
A simple cold paper wallet generator for Ripple XRP's!

# Instructions
It's pretty simple. Just download the .HTML file and run it in a browser.
I recommend Google Chrome as this works best and allows a landscape printing mode.
Safari works well enough but does not allow landscape.

For extra safety, copy the .html file to a USB stick and run it from a seperate laptop or computer that you trust and disconnect it from the internet.
