# RipplePaperWallet
A simple cold paper wallet generator for Ripple XRP's!

# Instructions
It's pretty simple. Just download the .HTML file and run it in a browser.
I recommend Google Chrome as this works best and allows a landscape printing mode.
Safari works well enough but does not allow landscape.

For extra safety, copy the .html file to a USB stick and run it from a seperate laptop or computer that you trust and disconnect it from the internet.

**If you generate an address, make sure you test it first by depositing *AND* spending a small amount before pouring all your XRP into it!**

I made this tool for the same reason bitcoinpaperwallet was created. I wanted to make it easier for people to "gift" XRP or make an "idiot-proof" wallet.

This will hopefully also help raise awareness and acceptance of XRP as a digital token..
