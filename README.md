# RipplePaperWallet
A simple cold paper wallet generator for Ripple XRP's!

# Instructions
Check out the wallet generator here:

I recommend running it offline in a secure environment rather than online.

It's pretty simple. Just download the .HTML file and run it in a browser.
I recommend Google Chrome as this works best and allows a landscape printing mode.
Safari works well enough but does not allow landscape.

For extra safety, copy the .html file to a USB stick and run it from a seperate laptop or computer that you trust and disconnect it from the internet.

**If you generate an address, make sure you test it first by depositing *AND* spending a small amount before pouring all your XRP into it!**


# Instructions
Tips:
- You could use a hologram sticker to keep the private key closed.
- Laminate the paper to protect it.
- Don't use an online printing service.
- Only use computers, printers and networks you trust during this process.

I made this tool for the same reason bitcoinpaperwallet was created. I wanted to make it easier for people to "gift" XRP or make an "idiot-proof" wallet.

This will hopefully also help raise awareness and acceptance of XRP as a digital token..
